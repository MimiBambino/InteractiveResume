Interactive Resume
==================
The live url for this repository is: http://mimibambino.github.io/InteractiveResume/.
This project was originally created as the 2nd project for Udacity's Frontend Developer Nanodegree.
It has various interactive elements over a traditional static resume.  I try to keep it up to date
and I intend to frequently improve it.


While this was originally created for the Udacity Nanodegree, it is not the version I turned in because I had trouble implementing Google Maps which was required for the project.  I eventually 
made another resume to turn in, the repository for which can be found here: https://github.com/MimiBambino/Resume.
